* About
This is a spartan Emacs fork of nano-minimal.el of the [[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs][Nano Emacs Project]] based on the following Github gist:

https://gist.github.com/rougier/8d5a712aa43e3cc69e7b0e325c84eab4

The goal of this fork is to keep the theme, but remove some opinionated parts such as the following:

- nano emacs bindings and helpers (prefer to leave this to the user)
- pop-up-windows (setting is problematic with magit)
- various minibuffer changes are removed (settings are problematic with vertico)
- benchmarking related code (seems excessive)
- command line chooser (seems obsessive)

A few things are re-added, such as:

- The application titlebar was originally removed, but this is quite opinionated and possibly damning to accessibility
- The 32 pixel gaps are reduced to 16 to improve screen real estate while retaining some vanity
- The splash screen is reintroduced from the nano-emacs full project, as it is pretty

Of note, this theme assumes you have the "Roboto Mono" font installed, and is required for a correct display
