* features:

  - use pgtk gccemacs with native json parsing with eglot (language server protocol) for ultimate performance
  - simple configuration with minimal abstraction
  - auto bootstrap self
  - prefer built-ins
  - doesn't mess with use-package, deferral, the pdumper -- doesn't care about start time

  - audit third party packages and track them in vetted/
  - for larger, [difficult to audit] but well reputed third-party packages: prefer gnu elpa > melpa
  - basically the only third-party packages being installed from repos are:

    magit (melpa stable)
    which pulls in:
    dash (GNU elpa)
    transient (melpa stable)
    with-editor  (melpa stable)

    eglot (GNU elpa, only depends on Emacs)

  - free software, public domain, no warranty (fork the repo and make it your own)

  - happy hacking
