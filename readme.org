* spartan emacs

** features:

  - no syntax highlighting
  - use pgtk gccemacs with native json parsing with eglot (language server protocol) for ultimate performance
  - simple configuration with minimal abstraction
  - auto bootstrap self
  - prefer built-ins
  - doesn't mess with use-package, deferral, the pdumper -- doesn't care about start time

** security conscious
  - audit third party packages and track them in vetted/
  - for larger, [difficult to audit] but well reputed third-party packages: prefer gnu elpa > melpa
  - basically the only third-party packages being installed from repos are:

    magit (melpa stable)
    which pulls in:
    dash (GNU elpa)
    transient (melpa stable)
    with-editor  (melpa stable)

    eglot (GNU elpa, only depends on Emacs)

** languages preconfigured (geared for devops usage)

    Bash
    Python
    Systemd
    Nginx
    Docker
    Tramp

** how to hack

   - fork the repo and make it your own
   - if ~/.emacs.d/override.el exists it will load last

** how to update

   - config

   `git pull`

   - emacs

   `pikaur -Syu emacs-pgtk-native-comp-git`

   M-x package-list-packages, then U followed by x

   ** license

  - free software, public domain, no warranty

  - happy hacking
