***** when [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][emacs-starter-kit]] is too elitist and spacemacs/doom/prelude/purcell/radian/... are too bloated.

*** features:

    - no syntax highlighting
    - use pgtk gccemacs with native json parsing with eglot (language server protocol) for ultimate performance
    - simple configuration with minimal abstraction
    - auto bootstrap self
    - prefer built-ins
    - doesn't mess with use-package, deferral, the pdumper -- doesn't care about start time

*** security conscious

    - audit third party packages and track them in vetted/
    - for larger, [difficult to audit] but well reputed third-party packages: prefer gnu elpa > melpa
    - basically the only third-party packages being installed from repos are:

      magit (melpa stable)
      which pulls in:
      dash (gnu elpa)
      transient (melpa stable)
      with-editor  (melpa stable)

      eglot (gnu elpa, only depends on emacs)
