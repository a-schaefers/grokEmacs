  If you feel like spacemacs/doom/prelude/purcell/radian/... are too bloated,
  while rolling your own as described in [[https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit][emacs-starter-kit]]
  may be too time consuming... And if you are looking for a simple and well organized base to build on,
  then Spartan Emacs might be a good choice for you.

** QUICK INSTALL

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git clone https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC

*** FEATURES

    - Simple, clean configuration and a comprehensible layers system
    - Prefer built-ins for simplicity, performance, reliability and security reasons
    - [[https://www.google.com/search?q=why+not+syntax+highlighting+is+better][No syntax highlighting]]
    - Doesn't mess with use-package, deferral, the pdumper -- doesn't care about start time
    - Tested on Linux, but should work also work fine on any gnu/bsd/macos base
    - Tuned for [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-performance.el][ultimate performance]] using the latest *pgtk* *gccemacs* with native *json* parsing with *eglot* language server protocol  (not required, just recommended...)
    - Optional evil mode, projectile, etc. (more layers coming soon...)

*** SECURITY / DEPENDENCY CONSCIOUSNESS

    - Audit third party packages and track them in vetted/ (TODO: Move to a gitsubmodule model...)

    - For larger, [difficult to audit] but well reputed third-party packages: prefer gnu elpa > melpa

    - By default, the only third-party packages being installed from repos are:

      magit (melpa)
      which pulls in:
      dash (gnu elpa)
      transient (melpa)
      with-editor  (melpa)

      eglot (gnu elpa, only depends on emacs)

      exec-path-from-shell (melpa, only for macos and gnome users)

      evil-mode,projectile (melpa, optional-- and whatever dependencies they pulls in...)

*** LANGUAGES PRECONFIGURED

    - Lisp/Scheme
    - Bash
    - Python
    - More coming soon... / send a PR

*** HOW TO HACK

    - Fork repo, clone it, own it.

*** HOW TO UPDATE

    - *git pull*

    - *M-x package-list-packages*, then *u* followed by *x*

*** ASSUMPTIONS

    - GNU or BSD coreutils

    - Adobe source code pro font

    - For Bash: i prefer installing shellcheck-bin (recommended) and only using that as it has better diagnostics
      than bash-language-server currently.

    - For python: *pip install --user pipenv python-language-server[all]*

      after that, eglot and lsp should be working automatically.

      if i want to setup a pipenv project with project dependency tracking, i'll do something like,

      *pipenv install --dev --pre python-language-server[all]*

      in the project directory... after that *pipenv run emacs* to use the environment that way.

*** KEY BINDS

    - Default emacs binds (unless you enable evil)

    - Principally, we want to use short M-x aliases, while also putting global function binds on C-c and
      language specific binds on M-m prefixes

    - Do look at [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-binds-global.el][spartan-binds-global.el]] to get
      the general idea, however.

      M-x ff (find files) ,
      M-x rg (rgrep files) ,
      M-x kr (browse-kill-ring) ,
      M-x ed (ediff) ,
      M-x git (magit) ,
      M-x lint (flymake) ,
      M-x tb (termbin) ,
      M-x sh (better-shell) ,
      <f5> (compile) ,
      <f6> (script execute) ...

    - Also see [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-eglot.el][spartan-eglot.el]] for language-server-protocol binds

    - And for language-specific files, see relevant language file e.g. [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-python.el][spartan-python.el]]

    - Lastly, if not using evil, I recommend swapping left-alt with left-control in your desktop settings for ergonomic reasons. I've been doing it for years,
      and it basically solves the infamous "Emacs pinky" RSI issue.
