** For when https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit is too elitist and Spacemacs/Doom/Prelude/Purcell/Radian/... are too bloated.

*** features:

    - no syntax highlighting
    - use pgtk gccemacs with native json parsing with eglot (language server protocol) for ultimate performance
    - simple configuration with minimal abstraction
    - auto bootstrap self
    - prefer built-ins
    - doesn't mess with use-package, deferral, the pdumper -- doesn't care about start time

*** security conscious

    - audit third party packages and track them in vetted/
    - for larger, [difficult to audit] but well reputed third-party packages: prefer gnu elpa > melpa
    - basically the only third-party packages being installed from repos are:

      magit (melpa stable)
      which pulls in:
      dash (GNU elpa)
      transient (melpa stable)
      with-editor  (melpa stable)

      eglot (GNU elpa, only depends on Emacs)

*** languages preconfigured (geared for devops usage)

    Bash
    Python
    Systemd
    Nginx
    Docker
    Tramp
