* SPARTAN EMACS

  Finally, a simple base Emacs configuration framework

  A word for beginners:

  Spartan Emacs is a framework, not a starter kit. It does not teach Emacs. If you are new, and please begin by checking out `M-x help-with-tutorial`.
  `M-x` means meta ('alt') + `x` and then `help-with-tutorial` Return (enter) to begin. One might follow up with `An Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp`
  additionally. The manuals may all be found at https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/

Spartan Emacs gets a haircut. 2.0, because 1.0 it wasn't masochist enough.

Reminder, this is an opinionated framework.

  - README.md <<< Updated more thoroughly

  - Why we still are not using `use-package or `straight.el

    So, until they make it in to core, I'm not gonna bother. In my practice, if I need those tools, then I just have too much stuff going on and Emacs needs to be simplified.

    Yes, yes... Straight.el is good stuff, I get it. We can use it to make this Distro reproducible.
    But you know -- I have a lot of other work to do that is more important. It's been years now and I still haven't gotten around to it.
    I'd accept a PR if it was documented with how to migrate to, and the basics of how to use it, pinning our packages, how to upgrade them, roll back, etc.

  - Theme, Syntax highlighting stays.

    Angryfruit is standard now. + A global font size option is now in the theme file.

  - Removed attempts to make things nicer for macos.

    If you're on mac, you're on your own.

  - Removed emacs-nw layer

    This fixes copy/paste issues people would have in the terminal.

    And remotely running Emacs? Just use tramp.

    And I don't care about your terminal transparency.

  - Removed spartan-environment layer, moved PAGER/EDITOR settings to better-defaults

    The insanity of managing PATH from Emacs is over. With all the virtualenv and nix-shell type of approaches, I recommend instead now to just open `emacs` from your terminal shell.

  - Removed unneccessary layers that I don't find useful: spartan-{solidity,json,yaml,xml,nginx,systemd}

  - Removed webpaste

    This is actually a security feature. I've had this one disabled a very long time. Can't be accidentally pasting company code to the WWW and losing our jobs, can we?

  - Removed the lisp layer's Clojure, Scheme and Common lisp support and renamed it to `spartan-elisp` instead

    I don't use those things anymore, if someone wants to open a PR for those languages individually I'd accept that and put them back in.

  - Removed vterm layer

    This is cheating. Use shell mode.

  - Language layers are zero maintenance now.

    Per-language keybindings using M-m are removed everywhere, for example, in spartan-python.el the following is gone:

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
     (with-eval-after-load 'python
       (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "M-m rr") 'python-shell-send-region)
       (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "M-m rb") 'python-shell-send-buffer)
       (define-key python-mode-map (kbd "M-m rR") 'run-python))
   #+END_SRC

   If you're gonna do this stuff, just DIY.

   Most language modes have builtins with `M-x foo-bar` type of features, and if you're in a language regularly, you should get to know your language mode layer,
   and perhaps consider customizing it yourself in `.emacs.d/spartan.d` where your overrides will load last during init.


** QUICK INSTALL

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     git clone https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs.git ~/.emacs.d
   #+END_SRC

   There are better ways, probably -- using symlinks. DYOR.

*** FEATURES

    - KISS, clean configuration and a comprehensible layers system
    - No third party packages install by default - prefers built-ins
    - Uses lightweight, mostly-vanilla configured layer packages
    - Popular langs come with optional layers that are preconfigured with the best modes, and intelligent LSP auto-completion, find def, etc. via Eglot
    - Project Awareness is available with Projectile, VC with Magit
    - Support for Evil mode with spartan-evil layer
    - Load time with all layers enabled is less than 1 second on a 10 year old laptop - without resorting to use-package, deferrals, pdumper or hacks.
    - Tested on Linux, but should work also work fine anywhere for the most part.
    - Tuned for [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-performance.el][ultimate performance]] using the latest *pgtk* *gccemacs* with native *json* parsing with *eglot* language server protocol  (not required, just recommended)

*** LAYERS

    - Edit `init.el` and M-x spartan-reconfigure

**** HOW LAYERS WORK

    - Enabled layer packages are installed during init
    - Then layer packages are configured in the after-init-hook
    - Finally layer packages may be user local customized in spartan.d/

      (all lisp files in spartan.d/ load last, during the emacs-startup-hook)

*** MINIMAL LANGUAGE LAYERS PRECONFIGURED

The idea here is to provde everywhere the get up and going configuration, this means  proper syntax formatting for rapid development,
and intelligent auto-completion and find definition, etc. via eglot's minimal language server protocol implementation. Some of the language modes also include repls.

Debugging is provided within many of the languages itself, e.g. Python and Ruby have builtin debuggers. With C, one may use M-x `gdb' with 'gdb', etc.

With compiled languages, one might use <f5> and set the compile command to something instead of make if needed, etc.

    - Emacs Lisp (paredit, builtins)
    - C / C++ (lsp)
    - Bash  (shellcheck)
    - Python (lsp)
    - Ruby (lsp)
    - Rust (lsp)
    - Go (lsp)
    - Javascript / Typescript (lsp)
    - Terraform (lsp)
    - Nix (just the mode)

*** HOW TO HACK

    - Fork repo, clone it, own it

*** HOW TO UPDATE

    - *git pull*

    - *M-x package-list-packages* => *U* => *x*

*** BINDS

    - Default emacs binds (unless you enable evil)

    - Principally, we want to use short M-x aliases, while also putting global function binds on C-c

    - Language mode specifc binds should be handled by the mode upstream

    - Overrides go in `.emacs.d/spartan.d/`

    - Do look at [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-binds-global.el][spartan-binds-global.el]] to get
      the general idea

      What else do ya need?! A repl, I s'pose. Well, good luck with that. As I've said, some modes have them included.

    - Also see [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-eglot.el][spartan-eglot.el]] for language-server-protocol binds

    - And for language-specific files, see relevant language file e.g. [[https://github.com/grandfoobah/spartan-emacs/blob/master/spartan-layers/spartan-python.el][spartan-python.el]]

    - No thanks. Nah, nah - Go ahead thanks.
